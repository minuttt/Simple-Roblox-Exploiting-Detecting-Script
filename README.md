# Simple-Roblox-Exploiting-Detecting-Script
A simple script for any game that checks whether the player is flying, teleporting or perma-death.

This script defines a function called checkForExploitation that checks for several different types of exploitation:

If the player's character is flying (i.e. if the velocity of the character's HumanoidRootPart is greater than 0 in the Y direction)
If the player's character is teleporting (i.e. if the distance between the character's last position and current position is greater than 10 meters)
If the player's character is moving when their health is 0 (i.e. if their health is 0 and their move direction is not 0 in either the X or Z direction)
If any of these conditions are met, the player is kicked from the game.

The script then connects the checkForExploitation function to the CharacterAdded event for each player, which is triggered whenever a player's character is added to the game. This will run the exploitation detection check for each player's character as it is added to the game.
